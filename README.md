## Overview
Welcome to the Techno Demo of 3D First Person Adventure game, made with UE5, C++ and Blueprints, a showcase of various features and mechanics developed as part of my journey in mastering the complete game development cycle. <br/> <br/>
![HighresScreenshot00001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f08a4f7-75e4-4c67-99ee-5ab9d06f98cf) 
## Purpose
This game was created primarily for study purposes. The aim was to practice and refine my game development skills, with a primary focus on coding every in-game system, from basic interactions to the core save system.

## Features
- **Diverse Mechanics**: Explore game mechanics that demonstrate my understanding of basic player interactions, physics, and system design for such genre.
- **In-Depth Systems**: The primary focus of this demo is the actual coding of every in-game system, ranging from basic interactions to the core save system and beyond.
- **Placeholder Models**: Visuals were not the primary task, so some in-game objects, like characters or several UI elements, have placeholder models. The emphasis is on the functionality and underlying code.

## Note from the Author
While this demo is a testament to the skills I have developed, it is important to note that this build may still contain minor bugs and is provided as a showcase rather than a playable game. Unfortunately, this demo does not include several in-game mechanics that I've developed in my standalone projects. However, it does feature the basic mechanics necessary for the Techno Demo to function. <br/> 
I appreciate your understanding as this project is a part of my learning journey. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome as they will help me improve and grow as a game developer.
